Music manager (mm) is a python app developed to manage your music across all your different devices.
It was developed with the idea of being as portable as possible in order to be able to run on most OS.
That being said, it has just been tested on windows and android :/

The purposes of mm are the followings :
- An intuitive ad-free easy to use music player, build to easily set playlists
- A youtube/soundcloud downloader, allowing mass downloads from browser recorded favourite links
- A sync feature allowing you to transfer music from your computer to your phone via your google drive



ARCHITECTURE: (20-02-22) LEGACY
------------
    - music_manager.py : code for the server, handling the api requests
    - download_manager.py : handles downloads ie link downloads and favorite folder in browsers
    - file_system_manager.py : handles replication of mp3s over both remote and local hard drives / edit metada files
    - data_manager.py : set editor / playlists generator / app users / music stats
    - upload_manager.py : uploads music from shared server


ARCHITECTURE: (12-04-25)

ROADMAP:
-------
    - music player
    - downloader youtube / soundcloud (/ spotify) from browser or search or link
    - Sync cloud (google drive)
    - playlists maker
    - blind tester

TODO:
    - Make an install/compile file/procedure for windows (mac/linux?) and android (ios?)
    - Make it compatible for all browsers (brave, chrome, firefox, safari, edge, opera)
    - Soundcloud DL + soundcloud playlist dl (test yt-dlp and current fucntion on the dlm)
    - Music player - create DB usage for playlist maker and favourite
    - (Online app : forum to share playlists)
    - Blind test (frontend + backend)
    - player UI + mobile
    - DL & sync (loader) UI + mobile
    - Playlist maker
    - greater list on browse
    - search song feature : local app + streaming
    - test all features with all types of files : ".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".ogg", ".m4a"
    - browse whole device to find songs/smoother song playback on slider
    - smoother song playback on slider:player's slider bug + popup time on scroll
    - menu button to browse all app screens (player/loader/blind test)
    - beautify
    - lyrics
    - cover image fetcher
    - metadata edit bug
    - bug: already downloaded song
    - to_upload filter also with cloud_inventory
    - auto sync
    - sync popup : no status call back
    - clickablebox
    - clm dl and upload mp3
    - github cleanup
    - write test list
    - popup to current style
    - m4a?
    - marquee bug 
    - 700 lines player.py

DONE:
    - Print usage
    - Make paths (bookmarks + dl destination folder) so it works for any users on any OS
    - Next song
    - Previous song   

GARBAGE:
    - test you-get with YT list and with soundcloud

PREREQUISITES: LEGACY (check requirements.txt)
    - Python3 (obviously)
    - Pip3

CHATGPT RESET PROMPT
--------------------

Hello chat, I am developping an app in python using kivy and I am looking for your assistance for the coding. It is called music manager and its purpose is to be a music player, loader and tester.
The player is a traditional music reader. 
The loader handles downloads from links (youtube and soundcloud), single links, batch of links and playlist links, uploads and downloads from google drive while syncing data across a pc and phone (using google drive as a bridge). 
The tester will be a blind tester and is only at the state of idea currently and will be developed post alpha.

The app architecture is kinda MVC. Kv templates define various elements, like if it was html. 
Behind it python frontend defines the dynamic behavior of these element and bridges deeper functions to the the backend (like if it was js).
And behind these is the the backend, that does the 'heavy lifting' and detain all logic that does not belong to the displays.

Heres a brief overview of my files in my project to give you an rough idea of whats there, I'll feed you the existing code as we go. 
Please always feel free to ask for it if part of the processes are missing to debug.

music_manager.py --> entry point of the app (contain main and generate all kivy screens)
backend/
    google_creds/ (...)
    model/
        Song.py
    controller/
        audio.py --> use by player.py to read music
        cloud_manager.py --> function related to google drive
        download_manager.py 
        file_system_manager.py
frontend/
    fonts/
    img/
        icons/
    kivy/
        loader_pc_ui.kv
        loader_phone_ui.kv
        player_pc_ui.kv
        player_phone_ui.kv
        theme.kv --> contains stuff everyone uses
    helper.py --> custom things/ animation / dynamic displaying... thing useful for all frontend
    loader.py
    player.py

    In future prompts, if I reference bc, ft or kv, I'll mean "code from (respectively) backend, frontend, kivy"
