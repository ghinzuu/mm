Music manager (mm) is a python app developed to manage your music across all your different devices.
It was developed with the idea of being as portable as possible in order to be able to run on most OS.
That being said, it has just been tested on windows and android :/

The purposes of mm are the followings :
- An intuitive ad-free easy to use music player, build to easily set playlists
- A youtube/soundcloud downloader, allowing mass downloads from browser recorded favourite links
- A sync feature allowing you to transfer music from your computer to your phone via your google drive



ARCHITECTURE: (20-02-22) LEGACY
------------
    - music_manager.py : code for the server, handling the api requests
    - download_manager.py : handles downloads ie link downloads and favorite folder in browsers
    - file_system_manager.py : handles replication of mp3s over both remote and local hard drives / edit metada files
    - data_manager.py : set editor / playlists generator / app users / music stats
    - upload_manager.py : uploads music from shared server
